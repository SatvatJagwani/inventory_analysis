# inventory_analysis

This was an internship project about analysing the inventory given by vendors to predict which dresses are currently in trend. I worked on this task under Mr Prateek Srivastava, from Adoro Marketplace Pvt Ltd, Mumbai, India.
The directory currently contains my written code and testcases, along with the final report.
